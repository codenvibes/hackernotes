<h1 align="center"><b>STEGANOGRAPHY</b></h1>

Steganography is the art of hiding information in plain sight. It involves concealing a secret message within another, unsuspicious piece of media, such as an image, video, or even audio file. 

The goal is to make the hidden data entirely undetectable to the naked eye or without specific tools. This technique differs from encryption, which scrambles the message itself but doesn't necessarily hide its existence.

Here's a breakdown of steganography:

* **Concealment:** Information is embedded within another file in a way that doesn't alter the original file noticeably.
* **Undetectable:** The hidden message is invisible to the human eye and shouldn't arouse suspicion.
* **Various formats:** Text, images, videos, and audio can all be used to hide secret data.

There are different types of steganography depending on the medium used to hide the secret message. Here are the main categories:

* **Line shift steganography:**  Adding extra spaces or line breaks between words to encode a message.

<summary><b><a href=" ">Image Steganography:</a></b></summary><br>

This is the most common type, where data is hidden within digital images. Techniques include:
    * **Least Significant Bit (LSB) insertion:** Modifying the least significant bit of each pixel's color value to embed data.
    * **Palette modification:** Altering the color palette of an image to hide information.
