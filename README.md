Generally, there are five steps in Hacking that one needs to follow. These are,

1. **Footprinting or Information Gathering**: This involves gathering as much information as possible about the target system or network. This can include information about the network infrastructure, system configurations, and potential entry points for exploitation. Methods for footprinting include passive information gathering (e.g., searching online sources, social engineering) and active techniques (e.g., network scanning).

2. **Scanning**: In this phase, the hacker uses tools and techniques to gather more detailed information about the target network or system. This can include scanning for open ports, identifying active hosts, and mapping out the network topology. The goal is to identify potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited.

3. **Gaining Access**: Once vulnerabilities have been identified, the hacker attempts to exploit them to gain unauthorized access to the target system or network. This can involve using various techniques such as exploiting software vulnerabilities, using stolen credentials, or leveraging misconfigurations.

4. **Maintaining Access**: After gaining initial access, the hacker may take steps to maintain access to the system or network. This can involve installing backdoors, creating additional user accounts, or establishing persistent access methods to ensure continued access even if the initial point of entry is discovered and closed.

5. **Clearing Tracks**: To avoid detection, the hacker may attempt to cover their tracks by removing evidence of their activities. This can include deleting log files, modifying timestamps on files, and removing any other traces of their presence on the target system or network.
